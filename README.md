# TCGA-Analysis
This Analysis was a part of a study which explored the inhibitory effects of fasting on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition using RACIPE and Genome
Scale Metabolic Modeling durning my summer internship at IISC, Bangalore.
The 76gs score was primarily used to categorize breast cancer cell lines from the TCGA HiSeq FPKM
database into epithelial, mesenchymal, or hybrid states. This segregation was necessary to reconstruct the
GSMM context-specific metabolic models. The 76gs score is based on 76 genes identified[28] which are
associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Common genes from the 76-gene list and
the database were selected, and weights were determined using Pearson’s coefficient. Each cell line’s 76GS
score was then calculated using these weights
